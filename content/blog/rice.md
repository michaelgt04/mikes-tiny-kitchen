There is no such thing as the ultimate version of rice. I love rice that's super
fluffy and grains that are really individual and separate. Others love softer,
stickier rice. You might even like different types of rice for different dishes!
The most important thing to figure out is how to get your rice the way you like
it, and that can only be done through trial and error.

### Base method

I'm going to give two different base methods for rice because I think it's
especially crucial to experiment to see what you like given how many different
ways rice can be cooked. You will
almost certainly fail at your first pot. In my case it was my first five or six.
Keep going, keep experimenting and you will figure it out. I've ordered the
methods by how easy I found them to get right.

#### The great rinsing debate

I always rinse my rice before cooking it, but it is
definitely not necessary. Some find it not to be worth the hassle, but I have found that it
helps me get really nice individual grains by rinsing off some of the surface starch that builds up on
rice during transport and storage. Before you get your rice, the grains are
constantly rubbing against each other on their way to the store. This causes
some of the starch on the outside of the grain to turn into powder and get all
over the other grains of rice. When cooked, this starch hydrates and makes the
outside of your grains a lot more sticky.

While there is are other ways to rinse, I rinse my rice by placing it inside of a colander.
This allows for quick and easy draining of the rice in between rinses. Once the rice is in the colander, I then place the
colander inside a large bowl. I put the bowl under a running tap and
begin swirling the rice around inside the bowl as fast as I can. The water turns
cloudy immediately; this is the surface starch. I keep the water running until the bowl fills up and swirl the
rice the whole time. Once the bowl is full of this cloudy water, I then lift up
the colander and pour out the water in the bowl. I put the colander back in and
do it all over again two more times. At that point, I've rinsed most of the
surface starch off.

If you rinsed your rice, make sure you get as much of the rinsing water off the
rice as possible and then you can proceed with either method below.

#### Method 1: Pasta method

1. Fill a medium sized pot with water and get it boiling

Get a pot of water boiling just like you're going to cook a batch of pasta.

You can salt the water here, but it really depends on how you're going to use
the rice. If you're serving it with something like roasted vegetables, you might
want to salt the water so the rice has a little more flavor on its own. However
if this rice is destined to be served with a saucy dish that has a lot of
seasoning, leave the salt out of the boiling water. The rice is more
of a supporting player in these types of dishes and you don't want to risk
making things too salty.

2. Put the rice in the pot and let it boil until "al dente"

This method really is like making pasta. Throw your rice into the pot, give it a quick stir
so it doesn't all clump together. Let the pot boil away. After the rice has been
in there
for about five minutes, take a grain out and taste it. Look for the grain to be almost
completely cooked through with just the tiniest bit of crunch in the center of the grain
when you bite it. The
grain shouldn't be really crunchy, just enough to provide a little bit of
resistance to your teeth right at the end of the bite, very similar to an al
dente pasta. Repeat this tasting every thirty seconds until the rice is at the
al dente texture.

3. Drain your rice in a colander and return it to pot

Once it's at the right texture, pour the rice into a colander, drain it and immediately return it to the
pot. Cover the pot with a lid. You don't have to be super thorough about getting
rid of all the water when you drain it. The residual water that stays with the rice will
continue to cook it as it steams, so any extra water that doesn't drain will be absorbed.

4. Let rice steam until cooked all the way through

With the lid back on the pot, let the rice steam _off_ the heat until cooked
all the way through. This usually takes a minimum of ten minutes. Really try to
hold off on checking if the rice is done until after this ten minutes
because every time you check, you'll let valuable steam out, which will get rid
of the water your rice needs to finish cooking.

5. Fluff and serve

When it's done, fluff the rice with a fork and serve!

- _Pros_

When I first learned how to cook rice, I found this method the easiest. It
didn't involve getting any ratios correct and works with pretty much any type of
rice. I had a much higher success rate.

- _Cons_

Depending on the brand of rice, the boiling can sometimes lead to grains
exploding instead of staying in their perfect shape. You also can't use an
flavored liquids, like stock or water flavored with spices to cook the rice. As
such, this method is best for times when you just want to serve rice as a base to
a meal or a side.

#### Method 2: Classic (or ratio) method

1. Measure out your quantity of rice

Measure out the exact quantity of rice that you want to make. One cup of dry
rice will usually make about three cups of cooked rice. For two people, if I
want a good amount of leftover rice, I usually start with two cups dry rice. I always
want leftover rice because there are so many incredible things that can be made
with it. If you're not as big of a rice fan, start with one cup dry.

2. Measure out the amount of water you've determined you need

Now this is where things get really, really complicated with this method.
Depending on who you ask, this ratio of water to rice can be wildly different. You need to figure
it out for each brand of rice that you use and each pot that you use. Different
brands of rice cook differently and the pot you use will change how much water
evaporates during the cooking, which also changes the amount of water you need
to start with.

To keep things as simple as possible, I recommend that you choose one pot and
make that your rice pot. Then always make your rice with that same pot to remove
one variable from figuring out your ratio. I also recommend sticking to certain brands of rice that you
buy over and over, rather than just buying whatever is on sale. Once you figure
out the rice to water ratio of a specific brand, you can be reasonably sure that
you can cook that brand with the same amount of water and get good
results.

Where to start with these ratio though? I _do not_ recommend starting with the
directions on the back of the package. For whatever reason, manufacturers often
tell you to use way too much water. I have almost never gotten good results by
following the back of the package. Instead, you should use the following ratios
as a good starting point:

Short grain rice: 1 cup of rice to 1 cup of water

Medium and long grain rice: 1 cup of rice to 1 1/4 cup of water

Brown rice: 1 cup of rice to 1 3/4 cup of water

If you're unsure of what type of rice you have, just check the package, it will
usually say.

From these starting points, fine tune your ratio to make the rice
that you want. If the rice was too mushy, try a couple tablespoons less water
per cup of rice next time. If the rice was still crunchy on the inside, add a
couple of tablespoons more of water. After two or three pots of rice, you should
have the ratio down cold.

3. Put the rice and water into your rice pot and bring to a boil

Combine everything in your rice pot and bring it all to a boil on high heat.

4. Once it boils, turn heat to low, cover and cook until water is absorbed

This takes about 14 minutes for me on my stove with my rice pot. It might take
slightly different amounts of time for you. If you are unsure if all the water
is absorbed, take the top off, give the rice a stir, and any water that hasn't
been absorbed will immediately appear.

5. Take pot off the heat, leave lid on and let rice steam for 10 minutes

At this point, you are just letting the rice fully hydrate. This step helps
to make sure the rice is fully cooked.

6. Remove lid, fluff rice and serve

Time to eat!

- _Pros_

This method is a little more flexible than the pasta method. It allows you to
cook with other liquids to add flavor, such as broth, or to add spices to the
cooking water, such as turmeric. It also leads to a superior rice. All the best
rice I have ever made, has been with this method. I find the grains to come out
more separate and with a more even texture.

- _Cons_

The worst part of this method is finding out the water to rice ratio. I failed
at this for so many of my first pots of rice made this way. It can be
frustrating to get right. If you cook with the same brand in the same pot over
and over again though, it largely negates this con.

### What could go wrong

- The rice was too mushy

The first thing I would recommend doing is rinsing the rice before cooking. This
helps minimize the amount of starch that will float around in your cooking
water, which in turn will help lower the stickiness of your rice.

If you did rinse the rice and it still came out mushy, your next steps will be
different depending on which method you used. With the pasta method, you boiled
the rice too long. Next time, drain the rice sooner. When
you're tasting it, try to get a little more crunch in the center of the rice.

For the classic method, use less water next time. When I'm trying to figure out
my ratio, I reduce or add water a couple tablespoons at a time. Amazingly,
this small change makes a huge difference. Use a couple fewer tablespoons of water the next
time you make that brand of rice.

- The rice was crunchy

In my family growing up, we referred to this type of rice as "bird seed".
This is way worse than slightly mushy rice.
Again, what to do next will depend on which method you used. If you used the
pasta method, boil your rice a little longer. When you taste it, make sure
there's a little less crunch in the center and the grain is cooked all the way
through.

For the classic method, use a couple more tablespoons of water next time. You
can also let the rice steam for a little bit longer after it comes off the heat,
but that will only help a little bit. Truly undercooked rice will just need a
little bit more water.

- You just didn't like it

If the rice isn't too mushy, and it isn't crunchy, but you just didn't like it,
then buy a different brand of rice. Different brands of rice, even if they are
the same variety, have different textures and different flavors. Experiment with
the different brands available. If you've had really good rice at a friend's
house, ask them which brand they use.

Also, it may be the variety of rice that you don't like. Look on the package and
see what varietal of rice you bought. Sushi rice tends to be more sticky.
Jasmine rice has a distinctive aroma that some people do not like. The same goes
for Basmati rice. These types of rice also are used in different cuisines, so
you might try having that variety with a different dish to see if you like it
better there.

- Keep it simple

There aren't a whole lot of different ways that rice can go wrong, its either
undercooked or it's overcooked, yet a great bowl of rice can be really
challenging for home cooks to get right. It certainly was for me. Don't give
up. Try to find a brand you like, experiment with your cooking method and once
you get that, cook it over and over again until it feels like you can't
mess it up. Once you get your brand and cooking method down, stop experimenting
with the way you're cooking it. Those experiments are all but certain to mess it
up.

### Start experimenting

- Use it as a base for anything and everything

There is pretty much nothing that rice can't serve as a base for. Roasted
vegetables, stewed beans, braised meats, sliced vegetables, an egg; all make a
really satisfying meal. If you have a leftover, and it doesn't already have a
starchy ingredient in it, try throwing it on top of rice. More often than not, it'll
be delicious.

If you're looking for something to make your bowl of rice even more exciting,
try putting different spice blends or sauces on top. Roasted sweet potatoes on
top of rice, drizzled with a smoked paprika [mayonnaise](/blog/mayo) go really well
together. You can also find many different delicious Japanese seasoning blends, such
as furikake, that are made specifically for sprinkling on rice.

- Take leftover rice and fry it

This can take a couple of different forms. There is of course the classic fried
rice that involves taking some leftover rice and frying it over high heat with some
vegetables. I have made this many times and it is a great reason to always cook
more rice than you need. Keep in mind, you can add anything you want to fried
rice. I recently made a Cajun inspired fried rice that involved sauteing
andouille sausage, wilting a
bunch of cooking greens, adding in the rice, frying
for a bit, then sprinkling in some Cajun seasoning blend. Experiment with
different add ins to your fried rice. So many different ingredients can go well
in fried rice.

Try making your fried rice in it in a cast iron skillet. To have success, you have
to use a good amount of oil, at least enough to coat the entire bottom, and then
get the skillet incredibly hot, to the point where the oil is almost smoking.
Once you add the rice, Keep stirring it to make sure that it doesn't stick. If it does stick, it
means you either didn't use enough oil, or didn't get the skillet hot enough.

I also love making crispy rice in an nonstick skillet using my leftover rice.
This is inspired by tadig, the Persian rice dish that has an incredible
crispy crust of rice at the bottom. Melt a couple of tablespoons of butter in a nonstick
skillet big enough to hold all of your leftover rice. Push the rice down in the
pan so it's as compact as possible. This packing is _key_ to getting the rice to
actually crisp. Saute the rice over medium heat until it forms a brown crispy layer on the
bottom, about ten minutes. _Do not_ stir the rice. Just leave it in one packed
layer. Using a spatula, you should be able to pick the rice up and
check underneath to see how brown it's getting. Once you have achieved the level
of crispiness you want you can turn the rice out onto a plate. It's a great way to add
some texture to a rice bowl and is even delicious eaten on its own.

- Cook your rice with a flavor liquid or spices and add ins

Now we're talking about some of the more advanced rice dishes out there, but also some
of the most satisfying. There are endless rice dishes that follow this technique.
Armenian pilaf, Arroz con pollo, jambalaya, the list goes on. I highly suggest
looking up some recipes as starting points, and modifying from there. These dishes
usually start by cooking the other ingredients down (e.g. sauteing onions,
browning chicken), adding spices, adding the rice cooking liquid (usually some
kind of stock or sauce), and then finally adding the rice to cook. These recipes
use the classic method of rice cooking with a measured amount of rice and
liquid.

I love my mom's Armenian pilaf. It's a pretty classic comfort food that I had a
lot growing up and is a great entry point to the world of more complicated
flavored rice dishes. To make it, you measure out one part of [fine egg
noodles](https://www.pennsylvaniadutchnoodles.com/our-products/fine-egg-noodles/)
to two parts rice. Melt two tablespoons of butter in your rice pot and add the noodles.
Saute until the noodles are a deep shade of brown. Add in the rice and stir to
coat with the butter. Season with salt and pepper. Then add in the appropriate amount of chicken stock,
depending on the water to rice ratio that your rice needs. Add an additional
quarter cup of stock for the egg noodles. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook,
just like you would in the classic method. Like many great dishes, this doesn't
have a lot of ingredients, but it is really delicious. Serve as a side or as a
base to a great rice dish.

Experiment with different add ins to your rice! As long as you try to keep your water
and rice ratios consistent, you will almost certainly end up with something
delicious. Sometimes this can even just mean including a little turmeric powder
in with the water I'm using to make the rice to get a yellow, halal cart style
rice. Rice takes so many different flavors well, so you have a lot of room to
try different things.

### Favorite brands

- [Goya Medium Grain](https://www.amazon.com/goya-enriched-medium-grain-pound/dp/b00bp40rhg)

Thanks Amanda. I had never cooked this rice before my girlfriend told me about it and it is
amazing. Pretty much the perfect all around rice. It cooks up super well, is
forgiving on the ratio and has an awesome texture. You should be able to
find this at most supermarkets.

- [Kokhuo Rose](https://www.amazon.com/Kokuho-Rose-Rice-15-Pound/dp/B0074L3QZ4)

This is another delicious rice. It's got a great, slightly chewy texture and the rice to water ratio on
the back of the bag is actually pretty much spot on. This rice you'll more than
likely need to go to Asian grocery store for (Amazon looks like their price
gouging right now because of the pandemic, it is not that expensive normally).

- [Shahzada Basmati Extra Long Grain](https://www.amazon.com/Shahzada-Basmati-Extra-Long-Parboiled/dp/B07778W42K)

My go to basmati rice will likely require a trip to an Indian grocery store. It
cooks up unbelievably fluffy and the grains stay very individual. The parboiled in the title refers to the way the
husk was removed from the rice _not_ the partial cooking that most parboiled
rice in the grocery store has undergone.
