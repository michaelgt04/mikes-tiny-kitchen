I spent a long time having no idea what to do with winter squash. The only times
I'd eaten it, I didn't like it. Spaghetti squash is a textural nightmare for me
and the ways I'd had butternut squash just didn't have enough flavor.

Then I ate the delicata squash dish at one of my favorite local restaurants
[Field & Vine](https://www.fieldandvinesomerville.com/). The roasted squash was
intensely sweet and the lemon ricotta underneath it balanced it perfectly. I
liked the dish so much, I even tried to recreate it at home, one version of
which is the picture above.

Find a winter squash that you like by trying lots of different varieties. The
flavor profiles are similar, but have subtle differences, and the texture when
cooked can vary a lot. I love delicata and red kuri squash for instance, but
still can't get behind acorn. Once you have a couple types that you like, play
around with the variables below and see what you can make!

### The background

- Look for firm squash

If the squash has give to it, it's probably been around for a while. Remember,
these are called winter squash for a reason, they are supposed to last for the
winter after they're harvested. Squishy squash usually means it was last year's
harvest and won't last long on your counter.

- You can eat the skin! (of some varieties)

Delicata, red kuri and even acorn squash don't need to be peeled to be eaten.
These are often the squash that look the most intimidating to peel, so don't be
afraid of them because you think they take lots of work to prepare.
Even though you don't have to peel them, make sure to roast these squash until
the skin is fully tender. Other varieties with thicker skins, such as butternut
and kabocha squash do need to be peeled. If you're at the grocery store or
farmer's market and don't know if your squash variety needs to be peeled, just
Google it, you'll find the answer quick.

- Roast a bunch at a time

Squash can take a really long time to roast. If you roast one squash, it doesn't
take much more effort to roast five squash. You can then cube or slice up the
rest of the squash you haven't used and incorporate them into other meals during
the week.

- Warm/earthy spices welcome

Cinnamon, cumin, za'atar and dried chiles all go well with winter squash. Toss
your squash with these spices after you're done roasting (you don't want them
to burn in the oven) or mix them into a sauce that
you're serving with the squash. They compliment the rich sweetness of your
squash.

- Compliment with some acidity

Speaking of sweetness, use a little bit of acid to cut through the richness of
the squash. Ricotta cheese, a drizzle of red wine vinegar or a simple yogurt
sauce all help to bring your squash dish alive.

- Add some crunch

For the longest time I didn't think I liked winter squash because it's just so
damn soft. All that soft sweetness can get a little bit blah after a couple of
bites, so squash dishes can really benefit from a handful of roasted nuts or
even coarse, crunchy breadcrumbs.

### Start experimenting

- Roasted za'atar delicata squash on ricotta cheese

Roast up some sliced delicata squash until tender. When the squash rings come out
of the oven, toss them with za'atar. On a plate, spoon down some ricotta cheese
and spread it out, place a handful of squash rings on top of the ricotta, top
with hazelnuts (or any nut you have). Throw some soft green herbs over the dish
if you have them.
