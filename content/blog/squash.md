### The theory

- Look for firm squash

If the squash has give to it, it's probably been around for a while. Remember,
these are called winter squash for a reason, they are supposed to last for the
winter after they're harvested. Squishy squash usually means it was last year's
harvest and won't last long on your counter.

- You can eat the skin! (of some varieties)

Delicata, red kuri and even acorn squash don't need to be peeled to be eaten.
These are often the squash that look the most intimidating to peel, so don't be
afraid of them because you think they take lots of work to prepare. Other
varieties with thicker skins, such as butternut and kabocha squash do need to be
prepared. Also make sure to roast those varieties you don't have to peel until
the skin is fully done and tender.

- Roast a bunch at a time

Squash can take a really long time to roast. If you roast one squash, it doesn't
take much more effort to roast five squash. You can then cube or slice up the
rest of the squash you haven't used and incorporate them into other meals during
the week.

- Warm/earthy spices welcome

Cinnamon, cumin, za'atar, dried chiles all go well with winter squash. Toss them
with these spices after you're done roasting or mix them into a sauce that
you're serving with the squash. They compliment the rich sweetness of your
squash.

- Compliment with some acidity

Speaking of sweetness, use a little bit of acid to cut through the richness of
the squash. Ricotta cheese, a drizzle of red wine vinegar or a simple yogurt
sauce all help to bring your squash dish alive.

- Add some crunch

For the longest time I didn't think I liked winter squash because it's just so
damn soft. All that soft sweetness can get a little bit blah after a couple of
bites, so squash dishes can really benefit from a handful of roasted nuts or
even coarse, crunch breadcrumbs.

### Put into practice

- Roasted za'atar delicata squash on ricotta cheese

Roast up some delicata squash sliced into donuts until tender. When they come out
of the oven, toss them with za'atar. On a plate, spoon down some ricotta cheese
and spread it out, place a handful of squash rings on top of the ricotta, top
with hazelnuts (or any nut you have). Throw some soft green herbs over the dish
if you have them.
