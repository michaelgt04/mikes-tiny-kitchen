Mayonnaise intimidated me a lot when I first started cooking.
Mayonnaise is an emulsion, which is just a fancy word for holding two liquids together that don't
normally mix. Emulsions have a reputation for being difficult to create because the liquids in them don't want to be together.
In the case of mayo, and many cooking emulsions, the two liquids
are water (in the egg and vinegar) and oil. Emulsions can use an emulsifier to hold everything together. The emulsifier
serves as a binder that holds the water and oil so they
don't separate. Egg yolks contain lots of emulsifier and so mayonnaise, when
done right, is a really stable emulsion, meaning it won't separate back into
water and oil. If you add the oil too quick though, or
don't incorporate all the ingredients thoroughly, you can end up with a soupy
mess of oil and egg yolk. I did not want to end up with this soup.

When I finally gave it a try though, I was
pleasantly surprised at how straightforward making mayonnaise was. As long as
you add the oil slow, it'll come together. The homemade mayo had much better
flavor and a more creamy texture than store-bought. It also served as an awesome base for many
other delicious dishes.

### Base method

1. Put one whole egg, a little bit of Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar and some salt
   into a large bowl and mix

Somewhat controversially, we'll be using a whole egg in the base method. This
makes a mayonnaise much closer to what most Americans grew up on, rather than
richer French-style aioli made with only egg yolk. I think this serves as a better starting
point for making mayonnaise at home.

Crack a whole egg into a large bowl (you'll want the extra room for whipping).
Then add about a teaspoon of Dijon mustard into the
bowl. Mustard is also an emulsifier so this gives you a little emulsion insurance
without adding a noticeable mustard taste.

Then add about a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar (feel free to add more if you want
your mayo to have a little more zing). A little extra liquid further helps to keep your
emulsion stable. Adding this in the form of vinegar will give a little extra
tang and flavor to your mayonnaise. Feel free to add more vinegar for more
lightness or to experiment with different types of vinegar to see what they
change. I've used malt vinegar and sherry vinegar and it's amazing to see the subtle but
noticeable difference in the final flavor.

Finally, add some salt. I go with about a teaspoon, but add more or less
depending on your taste. It's important to add the salt at this step, because
once you start adding oil, the salt will have a much harder time dissolving and
your seasoning will be a little more uneven. That's not to say you can't save
an underseasoned mayonnaise at the end by adding a little salt, it's just going
to make life a little more difficult.

2. Start drizzling in vegetable oil, whisk to fully incorporate

_Go slow!_ The most important thing to do when you start the mayonnaise is to
add the oil very slowly. It doesn't have to be a drop at a time, that'll take
forever, but you should add it about a tablespoon at a time for the first three
to four oil additions. Then you can add it a little faster. If you start adding
more at a time, gradually increase the amount you're adding and always, always,
always make sure to whisk the mayo until _all_ the oil is incorporated. If you
don't do that, you greatly increase the chance the mayo will separate.

Keep adding oil and whisking until it looks like mayonnaise. Despite what
everyone on the internet might have you think, this isn't an exact science. Add
oil and keep whisking until it looks like the consistency that you want. You
will most likely be slightly taken aback by the amount of oil it takes to get to
the thick consistency that we know and love. You will work through the shock
once you taste how good it is.

I'm having you use vegetable oil in the base method, because it produces the
cleanest tasting mayonnaise, most similar to the ones I grew up with. You can
feel free to add whatever oils you want though, as I'll discuss more in the
experimenting section below. Want to add a little olive oil for some richness and
fruitiness? Go for it. How about a few drops of sesame oil for some savoriness?
Sounds good to me. Make it your own.

3. Taste and season

Once you've got the mayo to the consistency that you want, take a little
spoonful and try some, or get a vegetable and dip it in. If it doesn't
taste like much, add some more salt. If it's too salty, add in a little more
vinegar and oil and incorporate.

This is also the point that you can turn your mayonnaise into dipping sauces,
dressings, and drizzles. Pesto, garlic paste, smoked paprika, just about any herb
you can imagine or even just some ground black pepper all make great additions.
As always, make it your own and try different combinations.

### What could go wrong

- My mayonnaise separated/the oil wouldn't incorporate

What part of slow did you not understand? Just kidding. Don't worry, this has
happened to me too, usually when I'm in a rush. If no matter how much mixing
you did, the oil just wouldn't incorporate into the egg mixture, you probably
added it too fast. If this happens to you, you can try and save the mixture by adding in another egg or
more mustard and vinegar and whisking really fast. It really depends on how
badly the mayo has separated. Sometimes you've just got to cut your losses and
try again.

Remember, next time start really slow at the beginning, just adding a tablespoon
of oil at a time. Gradually increase the amount of oil you add at a time. Don't go from
pouring two tablespoons in to immediately dropping half a cup in.

- It's kind of runny

Just keep adding oil in. There's usually a moment right before I get to the
right consistency that I think it's never going to happen. That's how you know
you're close. Keep adding oil in and I promise the mayonnaise will thicken up.

- It has a weird "off" taste

You probably used old, rancid oil. Oil does indeed go bad/rancid after a period
of time sitting on your shelf. Don't use oil that you opened a year ago (that's
about how long the shelf life is on vegetable oil once you open it). If you're
unsure of how old the oil is, just give it a smell. If it has an "off" aroma, it's
going to have an "off" flavor. Use a different oil.

- It doesn't taste like much

There's two potential issues here: either you didn't use enough salt, or you
prefer a different style of mayonnaise. Add a little more salt to the mayonnaise
to fix the first issue. It'll need extra help dissolving at
this stage in the game, so make sure you whip it in thoroughly once you
add it before tasting again.

If that doesn't work, you may just prefer a different style of mayonnaise. As I
mentioned at the beginning of the post, the base method most closely relates to the more
neutral flavor of the American mayonnaise that I grew up with (Hellmann's). If
you tasted it and don't think it tastes like much, perhaps you prefer a
mayonnaise more similar to French aioli. I'll go into more depth on this below,
but to do that, you'd use only the egg yolk instead of the whole egg and would
use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. You may also want to mix in a favorite
seasoning blend to the above mayonnaise and see if you like it then. A more
neutral mayo does serve as a great canvas for other flavors. You may be
surprised at how much it adds.

### Start experimenting

- Separate the yolk from one egg and use olive oil

There are a few different ways to do this. I prefer the egg shell
method where you pass the yolk between the halves of shell, but it
can be a little tricky to get the hang of while you learn. Use whatever method you
prefer.

Once you have your yolk, add in the little bit of Dijon and the salt from the
base method. You'll
also want to use lemon juice in place of the apple cider vinegar.

Next, stir in some garlic paste. Make garlic paste by mincing a garlic clove and
putting about a half teaspoon of salt on top. Smash the minced clove of garlic and salt
against your cutting board using the back of your knife. You're essentially
grinding it into the cutting board. As you go back and forth
over the garlic with your knife, you'll notice it turn into a paste
consistency. This might take a couple passes, so be patient.

Creating a paste works better than just throwing in minced garlic because it
will allow the texture of the mayonnaise to stay creamy. The garlic flavor also disperses more evenly
throughout mixture when ground into a paste. Minced garlic would leave little bits of overpowering flavor
and a grainy texture.

After you add your garlic paste, whisk in olive oil following the method above.

This is a much more strongly flavored mayonnaise. You might be a little
surprised by the flavor if you've had "aioli" at a restaurant before. Many
restaurants that say they're giving you aioli with your fries or burger are just giving
you flavored American style mayo. Aioli is often used as a dip for vegetables in
France and that's how I most enjoy it. If the flavor of the olive oil is too
strong for you, feel free use half olive oil and half vegetable oil.
Feel free to use it anywhere you would use mayonnaise!

- Add spice blends

If you like a spice or a spice blend, it will almost certainly make a delicious
sauce when mixed with mayonnaise. I love mixing cajun seasoning with mayonnaise
and drizzling on roasted vegetables and rice. Even just mixing smoked paprika
and a little garlic powder with some mayonnaise results in a bright red sauce
that can be put on just about anything roasted.

This is where things start to get really fun. You probably won't eat all the
mayonnaise you just made in one sitting. Rather than mixing your spice blend
into all the mayo at once, place just a few tablespoons of it in a small dish
and start experimenting. Put your new sauce on different vegetables, roasted or
raw, or spoon some on a plate and nestle some sliced meat on top. Thin it out
with a little bit of water and sour cream so that it becomes a salad dressing
and toss it with some greens. There are tons and tons of possibilities here. In
making just one batch of mayonnaise, you give yourself many opportunities to
experiment and innovate.

- Mix with equal parts sour cream, and thin with water until consistency of
  salad dressing

Homemade mayo makes a great base for salad dressing. Just add a little water into it until it's
the thickness you want for your dressing and then add in some seasoning. I also
like mixing it with sour cream for a little more acidity.

You can then add in lots of different flavorings. Puréeing the mixture with a
handful of soft herbs, like cilantro, parsley and tarragon will give you
something close to green goddess dressing. Mixing in equal parts dill, onion
powder and garlic powder will bring the dressing into ranch territory. Adding
blue cheese will give you a great dip for wings. Mayonnaise is a blank
slate for flavor and this is yet another application where it shines.

- Add a couple of tablespoons more of Dijon mustard and turn it into Dijonnaise

This is truly one of the great condiments out there and it goes well with so much.
Sandwiches, roasted potatoes, sausages, salad greens, pretty much any vegetable
you'd want to eat raw. If you like mustard and mayonnaise, this is the dream
combo.

I added about a couple tablespoons of Dijon mustard to a half cup of mayonnaise
and used it to dress the arugula in the picture above. It made a great topper for
breakfast sandwiches.

You can add in so many other condiments to mayonnaise and end up with a great
sauce, so experiment. At this point, we pretty much all know about how good
sriracha and mayo are together. So are ketchup and mayo. And don't forget about
hot sauce.

- You can also make it in a blender

Using the same ingredients, you can feel free to use a blender to do your
mixing. I just prefer whisking by hand for the added control that I feel like it
gives me on consistency and because I don't feel like cleaning up another
kitchen gadget when I'm done.

That said, mayo does come together really quick in a blender. First blend the
egg, dijon, vinegar and salt in the blender until combined. After that,
with the motor running, very slowly drizzle in the oil. Do this really
slow at first, and once it starts to thicken, go a little faster. Stop
adding oil when the mayonnaise is the thickness you want.
