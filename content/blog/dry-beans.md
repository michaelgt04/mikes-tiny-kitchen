### Master method

1. Soak beans for at least 4 hours, up to 24, with salt

This gives your beans a head start on cooking by fully hydrating them. This is especially important
if you don't know how old your beans are, and if you got them from the
supermarket, this is you. As beans get older, they continue drying out and that
means longer cooking times. You do not have to do this step if you have fresher
beans from somewhere that has identified them as this years harvest. Even still,
I always soak my beans because it gives me insurance on the beans evenly
cooking.

You should also salt the cooking water! I usually throw in a tablespoon or so of
salt per pound of beans. Remember, you're soaking in water here, so not all of
that salt is going into your beans. **Contrary to popular belief** adding salt
this early in the cooking process will not make the beans cook slower. It will
just make them taste well seasoned, and depending on who you ask, could actually
speed up the cooking of the beans.

2. Drain beans and put in heavy bottomed pot

The heavier the bottom the better, since it will conduct heat more evenly, which
will in turn help your beans cook more evenly

3. Cover beans so there is about one inch of water above the beans

Your beans are going to soak up quite a bit of water, and they need to be
submerged at all times during the cooking process. If your beans are not totally
submerged in the water, the ones that are not totally covered will not cook at
the same rate as the rest. You will then end up with beans that are stubbornly
crunchy after three plus hours of cooking. And you will wonder why you ever
thought cooking beans from dry was a good idea.

4. Add in your flavorings

This can be as simple as a teaspoon of salt or as elaborate as several spice
blends, fresh herbs, olive oil and pepper; more ideas on this will be later on
in the article. Add whatever you want (well almost) to flavor the beans. DO NOT
add any acidic seasonings at this point however. Acidic ingredients change how
the beans cook and will make them take longer and toughen up. If you want the
flavor from an acidic ingredient, such as lemon, consider using a part of it
that isn't acidic, like strips of zest, to add the flavor with none of the side
effects.

5. Bring your beans to a boil

Simple enough.

6. Immediately bring the beans down to a bare simmer

You do not want a crazy, I need to reduce this three cups of braising liquid and
it's 11 o'clock at night kind of simmer. You want just a few delicate bubbles popping
to the surface of your bean cooking liquid. This is to make sure that the beans
cook evenly and stay intact as they cook. Don't get impatient! I have been there
many a time. They will cook and turning up the stove too high will just turn
your little beans into a pile of mush. That said, as I also have learned before,
you can under do it. If no bubbles are coming to the surface of your liquid, you
are not at a simmer and need to turn the heat up. This is the touchiest part of
this process and will take some getting used to before you know exactly where on
the stove to leave your pot.

7. Stir baby stir

Whenever you think of it over the next couple of hours as they cook, stir the
beans. You don't have to go crazy, but this just helps the beans to cook evenly,
which is really tricky. Your burner and pot have hot spots, by moving the beans
around in your pot by stirring, you make sure all your beans get a turn in the
cozy hot spots and the frigid corners of your pot that won't heat up no matter
what you do.

8. Start tasting beans. When you taste five and they're all creamy, you're done

I heard an awesome trick on the Cooking at Home podcast the other day. When you
are trying to taste the beans to see if they are done, you should taste five
beans from different parts of the pot. If you taste one that's still grainy and
nasty (you will know immediately) your beans need more time. If you make your
way through five beans, you can be reasonably sure that the pot is done. If you
are unsure if they're done, they're probably not.

9. Serve

Now enjoy your beans! Add in any of those acidic ingredients you might have
wanted to put in before, like a little lemon juice or apple cider vinegar, stir
everything up and serve your beans. You can also top them with some crunchy
bits, like breadcrumbs or fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley. Just think about
what would go well with the spices you added in step 4.

10. Store the leftovers in their liquid

You need to store whatever leftovers you have in their cooking liquid. It keeps
the beans from drying out while you store them. So even if you are not eating
the beans with their liquid, do not pour it down the drain.

### What could go wrong

- My beans stayed crunchy

Oh the possibilities. As a good place to start, if you didn't soak your beans
try soaking them before you cook them next time.

If you did soak the beans, you
may just not have cooked them long enough. This was a huge problem for me when I
first started cooking beans. I read all these recipes that said my beans should
be done in an hour. Well, my dry as dust beans from the local supermarket needed
longer than that. I needed to have patience with them. Try cooking them for
longer and see if that helps.

If neither of those suggestions work, you might have just bought really old
beans. This can be an issue in the bulk section, where stores often mix up old
shipments with new and the beans can sit for quite a bit. Also, if there aren't
a lot of people in your area buying dried beans or cooking dried beans (I'm
looking at you New England) consider buying your beans online from a place with
higher turnover. Obviously I'll always tout the little guys, like [Baer's
Best](http://baersbest.com/). Don't let the website fool you, they are amazing
beans. Check out the [links](#small-bean-sellers) at the bottom for more small bean sellers.Amazon does also
have a pretty good bean selection though that most likely has higher turnover than
your grocery aisle.

- Lots of my beans burst

This one is a little more straightforward; you cooked them for too long. If some
are still crunchy and that's why you kept cooking them, see the advice above.
Some of your beans bursting is normal. It's really difficult to have them all
perfectly in tact. If around half of them are burst though, you might want to
cook them less.

- They don't taste like much

I had a lot of issues with this in my first batches. I didn't salt the beans
enough. Salt during the soak. This goes a really long way to making the beans
taste more evenly seasoned. Also, you can still add more seasoning at the end of
the cooking! So there is hope yet for your bland batch of beans. Add a little
more salt to the beans and feel free to add more spices. Woody herbs, like
rosemary or time, add the most flavor when they're cooked with the item, but
spice powders, like onion or garlic or really any spice blend, can go a long way
at this stage. Adding these spices while the beans are still hot helps to evenly
distribute them a little better.

- They took forever to cook (~3-4 hours)

I know I said keep the heat low, but it is possible to cook the beans at too low
of a temperature. Some really thick skinned beans, like Marfax, do just take a
really long time to cook. If you're cooking one of the more common varieties,
like black or pinto, they should not take this long to cook if you soaked them.
Next time, cooking them on a little higher of a temperature. If you didn't soak
your beans, make sure you soak them!

### Start experimenting

- Add a half onion and some pork/bacon fat to black beans

After you've covered the beans in one inch of water, cut a peeled onion in half
and add half of it to the pot (or go wild and add both halves). I normally save
the bacon fat that accumulates in the pan when I cook bacon so I can add its
savory flavor to other dishes. These beans are a great place to use a couple
tablespoons of it. Maybe a little less common, I also sometimes buy lard from
my local farmer's market. If I'm looking for a little less smokiness, I'll add
a couple tablespoons of lard instead of the bacon fat. If you want the beans to
be vegetarian, sub in olive oil for the animal fat. This variation is inspired by
Mexican style black bean recipes I've seen over the years.

- Render some bacon, add a chopped onion and a 1/4 cup molasses, bake at
  325&#xb0;F

Before you've added the beans into your cooking pot, render out the fat from a
half pound of bacon lardon, or bacon slices cut into pieces a quarter inch wide.
When those start to brown and the fat has rendered out, add a chopped onion and
cook that until it's soft and turned translucent. Then add your beans and cover
by with your inch of water. Add in a quarter cup of molasses (more if you like
your beans sweeter). You can also add in brown sugar here for all or part of the
molasses. Bake at 325&#xb0;F until the beans are tender and the bean cooking
liquid has reduced to be very thick. Beware, this could take up to 6 hours
depending on how thick the bean skin is. When there done cooking, stir in a
couple of tablespoons of Dijon mustard. You've got yourself some fine New
England style baked beans.

- Add lots and lots of herbs

After you've added your beans and covered them in the inch of water, add a bunch
of chopped or blended herbs. This summer, my girlfriend's mom taught me how to
make Puerto Rican sofrito, a magical blend of herbs and other vegetables that
adds incredible amounts of flavor to anything that it's in. If you are lucky
enough to have some, add that into your beans. The ingredients in sofrito can be
hard to find depending on where you are, but if you don't have access to them or
someone to show you how to make it, any number of different herbs are delicious
in beans. You could add a few tablespoons of basil pesto to a pot of white beans.
A puree of equal parts cilantro and onion would be a great addition to a pot of
black or red beans. Even hard herbs, like rosemary and thyme can be a great
addition to a pot of beans. Add the whole sprig or strip the leaves off the
stem, depending on if you want a subtler or stronger flavor.

As you're adding herbs, feel free to add some spice blends as well. Add cumin,
onion powder, garlic powder and coriander to a pot of pinto beans. Mix in some
smoked paprika and garlic powder to a pot of red beans. Experiment away with
your favorite spice combinations and don't be afraid to add in a lot. Taste the
broth as you add spices and see if the flavor comes through. If you're cooking a
pound of beans, it can take a lot of spice to make a meaningful difference in
the liquid. Make your pot your own.

### Small bean sellers

- [Baer's Best](http://baersbest.com)

A great heirloom bean grower out of Maine. All of the beans they sell are this
year's harvest, so you can be sure that they are fresh and will cook evenly. I
have tried over ten of their different bean varieties and all have been
delicious. They don't have a web store, so you'll need to call or email them to
buy, but the beans are absolutely worth it. Some of my favorite varieties they
sell are the Yellow Eye, the Marfax and the Black Coco.

- [Rancho Gordo](https://www.ranchogordo.com/collections/heirloom-beans)

These guys are some of the most well known heirloom bean sellers. You can go on
their website and order directly from them. If you have any specialty food
stores in your area however, there's a good chance that they will have Rancho
Gordo beans. I've seen them pop up more and more in the last year. Again, they
are a great product cook up super evenly.
