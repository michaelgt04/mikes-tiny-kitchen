### Master method

1. Soak beans for at least 4 hours, up to 24

This gives your beans a head start on cooking by fully hydrating them. This is especially important
if you don't know how old your beans are, and if you got them from the
supermarket, this is you. As beans get older, they continue drying out and that
means longer cooking times. You do not have to do this step if you have fresher
beans from somewhere that has identified them as this years harvest. Even still,
I always soak my beans because it gives me insurance on the beans evenly
cooking.

2. Drain beans and put in heavy bottomed pot

The heavier the bottom the better, since it will conduct heat more evenly, which
will in turn help your beans cook more evenly

3. Cover beans so there is about one inches of water above the beans

Your beans are going to soak up quite a bit of water, and they need to be
submerged at all times during the cooking process. If your beans are not totally
submerged in the water, the ones that are not totally covered will not cook at
the same rate as the rest. You will then end up with beans that are stubbornly
crunchy after three plus hours of cooking. And you will wonder why you ever
thought cooking beans from dry was a good idea.

4. Add in your flavorings

This can be as simple as a teaspoon of salt or as elaborate as several spice
blends, fresh herbs, olive oil and pepper; more ideas on this will be later on
in the article. Add whatever you want (well almost) to flavor the beans. DO NOT
add any acidic seasonings at this point however. Acidic ingredients change how
the beans cook and will make them take longer and toughen up. If you want the
flavor from an acidic ingredient, such as lemon, consider using a part of it
that isn't acidic, like strips of zest, to add the flavor with none of the side
effects.

5. Bring your beans to a boil

Simple enough.

6. Immediately bring the beans down to a bare simmer

You do not want a crazy, I need to reduce this three cups of braising liquid and
it's 11 o'clock at night kind of simmer. You want just a few delicate bubbles popping
to the surface of your bean cooking liquid. This is to make sure that the beans
cook evenly and stay intact as they cook. Don't get impatient! I have been there
many a time. They will cook and turning up the stove too high will just turn
your little beans into a pile of mush. That said, as I also have learned before,
you can under do it. If no bubbles are coming to the surface of your liquid, you
are not at a simmer and need to turn the heat up. This is the touchiest part of
this process and will take some getting used to before you know exactly where on
the stove to leave your pot.

7. Stir baby stir

Whenever you think of it over the next couple of hours as they cook, stir the
beans. You don't have to go crazy, but this just helps the beans to cook evenly,
which is really tricky. Your burner and pot have hot spots, by moving the beans
around in your pot by stirring, you make sure all your beans get a turn in the
cozy hot spots and the frigid corners of your pot that won't heat up no matter
what you do.

8. Start tasting beans. When you taste five and they're all creamy, you're done

I heard an awesome trick on the Cooking at Home podcast the other day. When you
are trying to taste the beans to see if they are done, you should taste five
beans from different parts of the pot. If you taste one that's still grainy and
nasty (you will know immediately) your beans need more time. If you make your
way through five beans, you can be reasonably sure that the pot is done. If you
are unsure if they're done, they're probably not.

9. Serve

Now enjoy your beans! Add in any of those acidic ingredients you might have
wanted to put in before, like a little lemon juice or apple cider vinegar, stir
everything up and serve your beans. You can also top them with some crunchy
bits, like breadcrumbs or fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley. Just think about
what would go well with the spices you added in step 4.

### What could go wrong

- My beans stayed crunchy

Oh the possibilities. As a good place to start, if you didn't soak your beans
try soaking them before you cook them next time.

If you did soak the beans, you
may just not have cooked them long enough. This was a huge problem for me when I
first started cooking beans. I read all these recipes that said my beans should
be done in an hour. Well, my dry as dust beans from the local supermarket needed
longer than that. I needed to have patience with them. Try cooking them for
longer and see if that helps.

If neither of those suggestions work, you might have just bought really old
beans. This can be an issue in the bulk section, where stores often mix up old
shipments with new and the beans can sit for quite a bit. Also, if there aren't
a lot of people in your area buying dried beans or cooking dried beans (I'm
looking at you New England) consider buying your beans online from a place with
higher turnover. Obviously I'll always tout the little guys, like [Baer's
Best](http://baersbest.com/), don't let the website fool you, they are amazing
beans. Check out the [links](#small-bean-sellers) at the bottom for more small bean sellers.Amazon does also
have a pretty good bean selection though that most likely has higher turnover than
your grocery aisle.
