      This will not be a site full of recipes. There are plenty of those out
      there. This is a place to learn a little more about the fundamentals of
      cooking from a fellow home cook and make that mythical jump to cooking
      without a recipe.
    </p>
    <p className="body-font">
      For a while, I followed recipes as closely as I could, hoping that my
      absolute fidelity to them would make me a good cook. I never knew why I
      did what I did and even more importantly, I never knew what I did wrong
      when dishes didn't come out the way I hoped they would.

      About two years into my cooking journey, I came across{" "}

      from our goddess Samin Nosrat. The TV show is awesome, but the book is
      even better (yeah, I'm going to be that guy). It showed me that while I
      had been preparing recipes for the last three years, I had no idea how to
      actually cook. I could rely on other people's expertise to guide me in the
      kitchen, but I had no idea what to do on my own.
    </p>
    <p className="body-font">
      The first tip I put into action from the book was to salt my chicken a
      couple of hours before I cooked it. I had seasoned meat like this before,
      but only when the recipe told me to do it. I didn't know it was something
      I could do to make lots of other meat dishes taste better!
    </p>
    <p className="body-font">
      This newfound knowledge embolded me to try modifying recipes. I threw a
      little leftover chicken into a kale pasta dish. It was delicious. I added
      in some extra cumin to the Tex-Mex ground beef I cooked up. I loved the
      added flavor. Those little successes started adding up and then I finally
      tried making a chicken stock from scratch without a recipe. Simple stuff,
      but my confidence kept building with each new dish.
    </p>
    <p className="body-font">
      The problem was, while Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat gave me a great starting
      point to jump off from, I still had so many fundamentals I didn't know. I
      love bread, for example, but I didn't have the slightest clue how to get
      started with baking my own loaves. I did a little research, but quickly
      confronted a fire hose of information that once again, overwhelmed me.
      Baker's percentages, decorative loaf scoring, dough temperatures,
      minute-by-minute schedules, I didn't need all that to get started and it
      almost turned me off to baking altogether.
    </p>
    <p className="body-font">
      I needed a resourece that would give me just enough to get started and
      build my skills, with places to look once I got comfortable enough to want
      learn more. That's what I'll be doing on this blog. All my articles will
      focus on either an ingredient or a technique. They'll tell you what to do
      with that delicatta squash from the farmer's market and what direction to
      go once you get comfortable cooking it. They'll also explain the basics of
      different techniques that you can use in your kitchen to expand on what
      you cook.
    </p>
    <p className="body-font">
      With that knowledge, hopefully cooking can become a little more fun, a
      little more creative and you can feel confident in your ability to cook an
      awesome meal from any ingredients.
